The Difference Boosting Neural Network (DBNN) published in  Intelligent Data Analysis, 4(2000) 463-473, IOS press, nl is a simple Bayesian network the apply an impossed conditional independence of joint probability of multiple features
for the classification of the feature space oercoming the limitations of the Naive Bayesian networks while at the same time maintaining its simplicity. The original code was in C++ and was used only by a selected group of people. 
The Python version is a rewrite in just a few lines of code with examples from UCI repository that can be downloaded and used to create training/test data to evaluate the model easily. A manual is in preparation.
